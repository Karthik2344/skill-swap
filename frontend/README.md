Project Idea: "Skill Swap" -- A peer-peer Micro skill barter platform
----------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ§© Problem Statement:
People have micro-skills (like guitar, sketching, Excel, resume writing, basic coding, etc.) but often canâ€™t monetize them easily or afford professional learning services. Thereâ€™s a gap in low-barrier, peer-to-peer skill exchange.

ðŸ’¡ Concept:
A platform where users can offer to teach a micro-skill and request to learn another from someone else â€” no money involved, just skill-for-skill barter. Users create profiles, list skills they can teach and learn, send barter requests, and schedule live or async sessions.
